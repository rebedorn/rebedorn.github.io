I planned and implemented tutoring services for three different Computer Science courses at UC Santa Cruz.
- In Winter 2019, I was a tutor for small groups of students taking Algorithms and Abstract Data Types. Additionally, I coordinated with the Multicultural Educational Program (MEP) to better support students historically marginalized within STEM.
- In Spring 2019, I led Modified Supplemental Instruction (MSI) sessions students taking Introduction to Algorithmic Analysis. Session attendance was up to 30 students at a time. This quarter, I was recognized for excellence in inclusive STEM education.
- In Fall 2019, I worked with students referred by the Universityâ€™s Disability Resource Center to hold one-on-one Artificial Intelligence tutoring sessions.
