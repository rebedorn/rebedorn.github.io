I helped put together the first instantiation of UC Santa Cruz’s Ethics & Algorithms undergraduate computer science course. 
- In Fall 2019, I surveyed and evaluated courses and research at other Universities spanning algorithmic fairness, differential privacy, and Simpson’s paradox, among other topics.
- In Winter 2020, I served as a Teaching Assistant for the course’s launch, helping create assignments and rubrics, and mentoring student groups as they built the final project.
- In Spring 2020, I served as a grader for the graduate adaptation of the course, providing comprehensive feedback to students and communicating with teaching team to update course content as necessary.
