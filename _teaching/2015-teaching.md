Habonim Dror North America is a Jewish social justice organization that uses informal education methods to train Jewish youth in advocacy efforts. The youth movement takes form in summer camp and regional activities throughout the year.
- In Summer 2020, I was the educational director for Habonim Dror Camp Moshavaâ€™s first online summer. I was one of four members of the camp leadership team, and led staff in building educational curriculum for campers entering grades 3 through 11.
- In Summer 2019, I was the Co-Director of the Youth Leadership Program. I designed and led an intensive 8 week leadership training for 16 rising high school seniors.
