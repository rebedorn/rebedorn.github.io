Hello! I'm a second year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Southern California's Information Science Institute. I am co-advised by [Kristina Lerman](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Lerman/Kristina) and [Fred Morstatter](https://www.isi.edu/~fredmors/). I currently use NLP to study gender equity, and am interested in algorithmic interference in social networks (particularly protest data). 

Prior to USC, I worked with Families USA in [swaying Congressional members to expand free health insurance](https://familiesusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/COV_Citizen-Children_Analysis-002.final_.pdf), and I also served as Educational Director at [Habonim Dror Camp Moshava](https://www.campmosh.org/about). Additionally, I earned a BS in Computer Science from the University of California, Santa Cruz, where I helped Professor [Lise Getoor](https://getoor.linqs.org) create the school's first Ethics & AI undergraduate course.
