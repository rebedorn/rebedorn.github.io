Hello! I'm a second year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Southern California's Information Science Institute. I am co-advised by Professors [Kristina Lerman](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Lerman/Kristina) and [Fred Morstatter](https://www.isi.edu/~fredmors/). Currently, I'm using Natural Language Processing to study gender equity. I'm also interested in quantifying algorithmic interference in social networks, particularly using protest data.

Prior to USC, I worked with Families USA to [increase health insurance subsidies](https://rebedorn.github.io/portfolio/) in the 2021 American Rescue Plan. I also served as Educational Director at [Habonim Dror Camp Moshava](https://www.campmosh.org/about). I earned a BS in Computer Science from the University of California, Santa Cruz, where I helped Professor [Lise Getoor](https://getoor.linqs.org) create the school's first Ethics & AI computer science course.
