Hello! I'm a second year Computer Science PhD student at USC's Information Science Institute. I am co-advised by [Kristina Lerman](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Lerman/Kristina) and [Fred Morstatter](https://www.isi.edu/~fredmors/). I currently use NLP to study gender equity, and am interested in algorithmic interference in social networks (particularly protest data).

Prior to working at USC, I worked with Families USA in swaying Congressional members to extend free health insurance and served as Educational Director at Habonim Dror Camp Moshava. Additionally, I earned a BS in Computer Science from the University of California, Santa Cruz.
