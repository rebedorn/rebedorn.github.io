Since 2019, I've collaborated twice with Families USA, a healthcare consumer advocacy organization. Full disclosure, both times the co-author was my incredibly passionate and hardworking Dad, Stan Dorn. We co-authored a [report](https://familiesusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/COV2021-32-Congress-Health-Care-Insurance-Beneficiaries-Tax-Credits_Analysis_LayoutB.pdf) which utilized the Censusâ€™ Household Pulse Survey to understand what subpopulations the HEROES Act could provide benefits for. From November 25, 2020 through December 23, 2020, we found:
- More than 4 million uninsured citizens utilized unemployment benefits. Of these citizens, about half were people of color.
- About a third of uninsured citizens on unemployment with housing were late rent or mortgage payments. Half of those with mortgages had none to slight confidence in their ability to meet their next housing payment.
- About a third of uninsured citizens on unemployment reported not having enough food.
- Less than a quarter of those uninsured on unemployment benefits had finished college.
The work was used by legislators to support the <b>American Relief Plan</b>, mandating that anyone on unemployment in 2021 be provided free healthcare for the duration of the year.
