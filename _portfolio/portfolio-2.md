Using the Census Bureau’s Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), we investigated the correlation between the Trump administration’s denial of lawful immigration for families seeking benefits including healthcare and child healthcare enrollment trends. We found that between 2016 and 2018:
- Citizen children with immigrant parents lost Medicaid coverage at nearly four times the rate as children with citizen parents.
- The proportion of children without insurance rose twice as much for citizen children with immigrant parents, compared to citizen children with citizen parents.

Families shouldn&#39;t be forced to choose between staying in our country or ensuring their kids get health care. As president, I&#39;ll roll back this policy. <a href="https://t.co/gG4gdveQsJ">https://t.co/gG4gdveQsJ</a></p>&mdash; Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1231234184032681985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
